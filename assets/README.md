# Asset Files Needed

This directory should contain the following assets for the Expense Tracker app:

## Required Assets:

1. **icon.png** (1024x1024 px)
   - App icon for iOS and Android
   - Dark mode theme with money/wallet symbol
   - Suggested: 💰 emoji on dark background (#1a1a1a)

2. **adaptive-icon.png** (1024x1024 px)
   - Android adaptive icon foreground
   - Should be the same as icon.png

3. **splash.png** (1284x2778 px for iPhone X)
   - Splash screen image
   - Dark background (#1a1a1a) with app logo
   - App name and tagline

4. **favicon.png** (48x48 px)
   - Web favicon
   - Smaller version of the app icon

## Generating Assets:

You can use online tools or design software to create these assets:

1. **Using Canva** (Free):
   - Create designs with the specified dimensions
   - Use dark backgrounds with money/finance symbols
   - Export as PNG

2. **Using Figma** (Free):
   - Design all assets in one project
   - Export at required resolutions
   - Maintain consistent branding

3. **Using Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator**:
   - Professional design tools
   - Export at exact dimensions

## Temporary Solution:

For development, you can:
1. Use Expo's default assets
2. Generate simple colored icons with text
3. Use emoji-based icons (💰)

## Quick Setup Command:

To generate basic placeholder assets, you can create simple colored squares:
- Background: #1a1a1a (dark)
- Icon: 💰 or similar money symbol
- Text: "Expense Tracker"

The app will work without these assets, but they're required for:
- App store submissions
- Professional appearance
- Better user experience
